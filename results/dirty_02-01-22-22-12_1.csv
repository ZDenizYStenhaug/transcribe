Well, atlantic city, the ship was stopped. It was all in the newspapers about it too. The crew had ripped the walls and put all liquor in the wall. So we all had to get up 3:00 AM. And oh it was a screen. The men were coming down their pajamas and bathrobes and they had bottles sticking all out all over and anyone could see they had the bottles and uh the captain says get rid of that stuff. They're searching the boats, they're downstairs ripping the wall upon. So they looked us all over and so lick errands bringing things in from cuba and girl in front of me. She had had a bottle, she's bringing in for my mother in law and they found that bottle in her bag. So they found a $50 and threw it over the side of the boat. So then I got panicking. I had about six little bottles and I thought I'll have to stay on boat and wash the dishes. I spent all my money down there. I was coming home broke. So the doctors are not allowed to touch the women, they send you down to the matron. So when do you want to examine me? He said you're a very sick woman, you better go down to the matron. See I was so nervous and upset that my pulse was going so fast and I couldn't talk mm hmm. And I was holding my coat around my stomach c so they wouldn't. And I guess he thought I was pregnancy because the bottles all started to move to the front. So he says, oh like a sick boom. You better go down to the matron and all I could think about was or if they ever find those bottles, I'll have to stay and ship a month to pay up for. If you if they find you $50 a bottle, I think I had eight and I was broke because I I've been down there a month and I've spent my money. So what happened? And she didn't examine me? She said, what's the matter? I said I'm so nervous. I said those doctors, they're fooling around. I said, my friend in front, they threw the bottle overboard. And I got all nervous and upset and she says, well I'll give you a pill and you calm down okay? But I would never bring liquor in again after that. I wouldn't go through that again for no souvenirs",0.8702692345924452,56.391,61.74833345413208,-1.0
