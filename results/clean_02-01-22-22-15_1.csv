New york city is in the northeastern part of the United States and most people think of the island of Manhattan when they think of new york period specifically, I visited Brooklyn for the most part and that is just to the east of Manhattan. Um, the weather was okay, a little bit chilly. It's pretty windy up there. But we bundled up and we walked miles every day just to explore the neighborhoods And of course to stay away from the COVID-19 virus. Unfortunately this is December of 2021 and the virus is sweeping through new york city once again. So we stayed outside. We walked, we walked across the Williamsburg bridge. We walked across the Brooklyn bridge and we also took the ferry so that we could sit outside. So I feel like it was a relatively covid safe trip period. I guess time will tell and let us know. Um, one of the best things about visiting new york and Brooklyn is that there are so many different kinds of cuisines, world cuisines that you can sample and I have to say. I think the best thing that I ate the whole time. I was, there was a bow, so spelled in english B eh Oh um, and it was a bow that had shrimp tempura in it and some sauce and some vegetables and it was amazing. But the cool thing is if you visit there you can sample all kinds of food. Get take out, stay away from people if you need to. And hopefully you two can have a great walking tour of the city for a few days and try out some new cuisines, happy holidays and my very best to you For the new year 2022.",0.904811671335201,37.462,47.41464567184448,1.0
