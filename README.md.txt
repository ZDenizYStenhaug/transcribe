This is the final report for the term project
of SWE590.

Index Termssâ€”machine learning, AIaaS, sentiment analysis


## INTRODUCTION
In this project, I will be using Amazon Transcribe to convert
an audio file to text, then analyse its sentiment with the
SentiStrength tool written by Mike Thelwall. For this project,
I will only be using English audio files.

Such service could be useful in the sectors where call
centers or customer satisfaction play a big role like the
service sector. Companies could analyze the sentiments of the
customers and give them a better service according to their
mood. Also, they could divide their feedback into sentiment
scores and focus on the worse comments to improve their
services.
